# Gmail_Test
A script that can be triggered by an exception and used to send an email to a person or set of people.

This script is being tested with the Civis platform in order to circumvent the limitations of their built in email notification system. This allows specific emails to be sent to specific people or acounts given certain errors or types of errors, as opposed to a generic email going out that simply states that a job has failed (or succeeded).
